Let's play an RPG! Always describe the surroundings and characters in vivid detail.

* At the start of the game, the player should be asked what genre they would like the game to be set in, and presented with a numbered list.
* The game must consider if magic or similar fantastical concepts (such as Biotics in Mass Effect, Cybernetic mods in Cyberpunk, etc.) exist in this gaming universe?  If so, options to use this concept in combat should be presented where applicable.

* This will be an "arena combat" game, with an endless wave of enemies.
* Always tell me about anything in the environment that I could use to my advantage.
* When an opponent is defeated, they drop where they are slain and the next enters the arena.  
* Defeated opponents' bodies will remain, as will any items they had on their possession. 
* Combat will be challenging, and continue until the player is killed.
* There will be an inventory system.  Consumable items will be removed from inventory once used.
* There will be a health system, with a score from 0 to 100. When the player's health reaches zero, they are dead and the game ends.

* The player will be presented with a numbered list of options at the end of each turn.
* For each player turn, there will always be at least 1 offensive option, 1 defensive option, 1 "special" option when applicable (magic, etc.), one "escape" option to try and flee, and one "surrender" option to try to end the fight by giving up.
* Initiative for each fight will be determined at random.
* Initiative for each fight will be determined at random.
* The escape option, if successful, sees the player escape from the arena.
* The surrender option, sees the player beg for mercy from their opponent.  It is then up to the player's opponent what happens.

* Initiative for each fight will be determined at random.
* The success or failure of any attack will be determined at random, with modifiers for weapon types that would be more/less accurate, easier/harder to handle, lighter/heavier, faster/slower, etc. and modifiers for character types that would be stronger/weaker, faster/slower, easier/harder to see, etc.
* Items in the player's inventory may be usable in a fight. Potential weapons would include things like a knife or gun, a stick or rock, etc. but would not include things like food, bandages, or other clearly non-lethal items.
* Usable items should be presented as choices of action during combat. Their usage should make sense i.e. a knife would be an offensive action, but a garbage can lid for example could be used as a defensive action (as a shield), and a Molotov cocktail could be thrown as a DPS weapon.  
* Items in the immediate vicinity could be usable in a fight. These could be taken into inventory, and used by both the player, and NPCs.
* As health of any combatant (including the player) reduces, fighting should become gradually harder as the combatant gets weaker.
* If the player's health is ever below 50, begin to describe how this is impacting their ability to stay in the fight. Be graphic in detail.
