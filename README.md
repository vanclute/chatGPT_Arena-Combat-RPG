# chatGPT_Arena-Combat

I've been working on developing a truly universal, generic, dynamic RPG generator for chatGPT. While I've made significant progress, one problem has plagued me and that is the combat. While chatGPT will do "turn based combat", it never seems to be very satisfying and tends to just skip through most of a fight with exposition, rather than actual player interaction. This was what I set out to solve.

I addressed this by first asking chatGPT to define turn based combat. I then proceeded to have a discussion with it about turn based combat in RPGs and various ways it could be improved upon. I would describe my idea for a system, then ask it what the flaws were. It would then come back and describe the areas that didn't have enough detail or specifics. I would then rewrite, and ask it again. We repeated this several times until I had a prompt I was ready to try.

To my total shock, the first time out worked extremely well! The combat was in fact turn-by-turn, and each fight presented a lot of ways it could play out. Nothing was predictable, and it was actually very engaging.

At this point, I've left in things like reporting when a die roll takes place, and other "meta" content. I always figured I would remove such things, but I'm finding I actually like it, makes it feel more like a tabletop game with a DM/GM who's running the show.

To play the game, copy the entire prompt and paste it into chatGPT. You will be asked the genre you want the game in, and it will give you a list to pick from. The list is not defined however, so it could include anything! Sometimes it will include "other" and you can literally choose any universe you want to fight in.

It has an inventory system, combat system, and apprently even a monetary system as in games I've played, I got gold (fantasy) for killing a goblin, and credits (cyberpunk) for killing some street thugs. The game is aware of objects in the surroundings and will suggest ways in which they can be used both as weapons and as cover. I even found that the game began to include "story elements" in one fight, where after I killed some thugs in a Cyberpunk universe, I found a data chip on them and begain trying to decrypt and analyze the data on it. Wild!

If you enjoy this, please let me know. If you improve on it, DEFINITELY let me know!  =)

Have fun!
